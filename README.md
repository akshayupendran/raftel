# About this repo

The repo is created to duplicate the environment I have on my PC.
Information of the WSL Setup I am using is present in [WSL Setup Information](./wsl.md).

You can easily install the above WSL Dotfiles by running [Install](install.sh)

The windows environment can be replicated by importing the [winget_export](winget_export)
